Welcome to Blackjack! The goal is simple: get as close to 21 as possible without going over. 
Youâ€™re playing against the dealer, and both of you start with two cards. Face cards are worth 10, 
Aces can be 1 or 11.

You can 'Hit' to take another card or 'Stand' to keep your hand. If you go over 21, you bust and lose. 
The dealer must hit until they reach at least 17. If you have a higher hand than the dealer without busting, you win! 

The first round is a little different, having a blackjack means you win right away, unless the dealer ties, then the dealer wins.

Good luck!
